|  Upgrade Version  |  Succesful print %    |  Upgrades Done |     Issues to be fixed   |

|   V1   | >10% | NA (First prints) | Hotend wires interferring with belts and homing, Filament on nozzle ruining first layers, etc., |
|   V2   | 25% | Preliminary hotend harness added, start gcode purge line upgraded)| Bed meshing and levelling inconsistent, first layer is not at correct height |
|   V3   | 30% | Bed mounts stiffened (improving meshing), Retraction added before and after prints to reduce ozzing)| First layer is still overly flawed (Curling up, stringing, etc.) |
|   V4   | 35% | Nozzle Wiper added, first layer accels and speed majorly reduced, and heat tuned for first layer | Warping and first layer adhesion still an issue   |
|   V5   | 50% |3 minutes added for heatsoaking and increased bed temperature| Bed adhesion on glass bed is still quite poor  |
|   V6   | 85% |MIC6 Bed added with textured PEI top but nozzle wiper had to be removed| Nozzle wiping needed and klicky probe reliability issues.
|   V7   | 89% |Improved Start and end Gcode has removed most need for nozzle wiping (nozzle wiper still will be added later though), klicky probe reassembled | Wire Harness will still occasionally interfer with homing |
|   V8   | __% | ______ | _______ |
